## Thread Title: {Discord/GitHub name} nomination thread

### Discord Name: {@username} / GitHub Name: {@username}

### Astro Badge: https://astro.badg.es/v1/contributor/{github-username}

### Contributions:
*(Include any/all sections below as appropriate. No particular section or item listed is required, but remember, not all maintainers will be familiar with your nominee! The items below will help you present the nominee's contributions to maintainers who might not know them.)*

**Code Contributions (all repos, including docs):**
- mention recent or outstanding PRs, helpful review comments, active discussions in the #dev Discord channel
- include links to: PRs, review comments showing helpful feedback on others' PRs
- point out any particularly valuable themes/areas of contribution, especially if the person has carved out a niche and started to "own" an area of the codebase. (e.g. i18n, a11y, translations, docs writing, tests, an integration)

**Support/Community:**
- describe general or specific helpful Discord activity you have noticed
- include quotes of helpful comments, links to Discord threads
- mention how they have contributed to the "vibe" in Discord and/or how they would make a good moderator (since maintainers may self-select as mods)

**Representation outside of our Community:**
- mention ways in which the nominee currently represents Astro positive outside our community on social media: Tweets, engagement with the official Astro accounts
- highlight any community meetups, conference talks promoting Astro
- mention any personal blog posts or videos that promote Astro. (e.g. video courses, live streams of working on Astro, blog posts describing how to build with Astro)

### Personal Endorsement message:

Use this space to write a personal message in support of the nominee becoming maintainer and your reasons for nominating. What would you like voters to know about the nominee that perhaps they don't and isn't adequately captured above?

### Your Responsibility as a Voter:
*(Please include this section as written, in its entirety)*

Please vote in the poll within 3 business days. Not voting within this period is equivalent to abstaining.

**If voting yes**, please include a comment or elaboration if possible. Our community is large and others may not know the nominee very well, so knowing that other maintainers approve can help voters who have not interacted with the nominee very much. Some of these comments will also be included (anonymously) in the message sent to successful nominees as "Here are some things people said about you", so it is helpful to have some positive comments to include and make the message that much more personal!

**If voting no**, a reason is not required, but please do mention any strong reservations you might have about the nominee. If you have reason to believe that there would be serious problems with this person having access to the repositories, moderation powers, or being seen as an authority figure on Discord or a public representative of Astro, then please voice these concerns. These concerns may be shared (anonymously) with the nominee if the vote passes.

If abstaining, no reason is required. You are still free to share any thoughts (positive or negative) about the nomination, and these may be included (anonymously) in the nominee's congratulation message.

**Before abstaining**, please remember it is your responsibility as a maintainer to help vet potential new maintainers. Just because you don't know them *now* doesn't mean that you must abstain! A quick investigation (following the above links, searching their posts on Discord, etc.) might lead to either enough information for you to vote yes, or to some concerns that will be helpful to this conversation. Even if abstaining, you may have helpful contributions to this process.
